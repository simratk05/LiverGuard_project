# SteamLit App

This repository contains the streamlit app code for Liver Disease data, in which values of various parameters were given to us in a csv file and classification was done on basis of if the patient is healthy or not. The app takes input various parameter values, and gives output accordingly.
The app URL is given as follows-

# Dataset

The dataset used was taken from my previous project, in which patient data was taken using different sensors and compiled into one .csv file

I used two models to train the data, Random forest and Linear Regression, the average accuracy of both the models was about 95%. Then i uploaded pickle file for the model and built the app.
