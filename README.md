# Dataset

The dataset used was taken from my previous project, in which patient data was taken using different sensors and compiled into one .csv file

I used two models to train the data, Random forest and Linear Regression, the average accuracy of both the models was about 95%. Then i uploaded pickle file for the model and built the app.
